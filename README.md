## **Install**

```bash
pi install npm:pi-aftc-toolset
```

Then in pi:

```text
/aftc-install     # installs better-sqlite3 + packaged SSH carrier deps (python)
/reload
```

> **Runtime dependencies:** `pi install` does not install all the required
> runtime deps. Run `/aftc-install` after extension installation.

## **Footer widget**

![Footer widget](images/footer-widget.png)

A themed dashboard bar below the editor (`/aftc-footer` to configure:
enable, averages line, timeframe). Lines 1-4 always available; line 5 only
for supported subscription providers; line 6 only while Sub Agents (/007)
is enabled.

### Line 1 - what's happening right now

Model name + thinking level, context window size with pi's own context-use
%, last-turn cache hit vs session average (with trend arrow), and the
session's cached vs new token split.

### Line 2 - your money and prompts

User vs AI prompt counts, last turn cost, live Task Time, Session Time
(wall-clock since your first prompt) and Session Time Cost.

### Line 3 - speed and tools

Turn thinking time and response time (last + averages), active tool count
with estimated schema tokens, and skills used/available.

### Line 4 - long-term averages

Prefixed with the chosen window (eg `3 Day Averages:`), from the persistent
usage DB: total cost, window prompt sums (User/AI), average cache hit %,
and Avg Task Time (completed tasks only). 19 windows via `/aftc-footer` →
Set averages timeframe: ten rolling "Last …" windows (1h-72h) and nine
calendar-anchored windows (1 Day → 1 Year).

### Line 5 - subscription quota (some providers only)

5-hour rolling + weekly allowance usage with live reset countdowns.
Supported: ChatGPT/Codex (OAuth), Anthropic (OAuth subscription headers),
MiniMax Token Plan, ZAI/GLM Coding Plan, Kimi for Coding. All other
providers: the line stays hidden — and it hides immediately when you
switch to a model whose provider reports no allowance. The numbers
refresh after every prompt, on model changes, and on a gentle 60-second
background poll, so you can check what you have left BEFORE starting a
big task (the poll backs off automatically if the provider's usage
endpoint is failing or has no credentials).

### Line 6 - sub agents (only while /007 is enabled)

Always visible while the Sub Agents feature is on: runs active vs max
concurrent, this session's total sub-agent cost, the average task time of
completed runs, and which agents are running right now (each with its
context-window %).

<br><br>

## **SSH**

Operate remote servers from pi - model tools for the AI, slash commands
for you, a full-screen interactive terminal for hands-on work. Everything
runs through a packaged Python (Paramiko) carrier over local stdio - it
opens **no** listening socket.

### Ensure dependencies are installed

```text
/aftc-install
```

Installs/verifies the carrier environment: Python 3 + `uv` + `uv sync
--locked` of the packaged sidecar.

### **SSH commands**

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/ssh-cm` (alias `/ssh-connection-manager`) | Full-screen connection manager: add / edit / delete saved connections |
| `/ssh-connect [name]` | Connect a saved connection (quotes for names with spaces; no name → picker) |
| `/ssh-connections` | List saved connection names |
| `/ssh-status` | Show connection status |
| `/ssh-select [id]` | Select the active session for local commands |
| `/ssh-disconnect [id]` | Disconnect a session |
| `/ssh-shell` | Open the full-screen interactive terminal on the selected session |
| `/ssh-close-shell <id>` | Close an interactive shell |
| `/ssh-interrupt <id>` | Send Ctrl+C + Ctrl+D recovery keys to a shell |
| `/ssh-upload <local> <remote> [--preserve]` | Upload a file (overwrite confirmation; `--preserve` keeps attrs) |
| `/ssh-download <remote> <local> [--preserve]` | Download a file (overwrite confirmation) |
| `/ssh-rename <from> <to>` | Rename a remote path after confirmation |
| `/ssh-auto-accept-session-on` / `-off` | Trust NEW host keys without asking / restore the prompt (changed keys are always rejected) |
| `/ssh-help` | SSH workflow guidance |

### How to manage connections

`/ssh-cm` opens the connection manager: `[ Add new connection ]`,
`[ Edit ]`, `[ Delete ]`. The add dialog collects name, username, host,
port (22), timeout (30 s), optional key path and optional password (saved
locally, never exposed to the model).

### How to connect

`/ssh-connect [name]` - or just ask the model, which uses `ssh_connect`.
New host keys ask for approval (or auto-accept when enabled).

### How to disconnect

`/ssh-disconnect [id]` - or the model's `ssh_disconnect`. Idle carriers are
reaped automatically and re-spawned on demand.

### Run commands and pick a session

`/ssh-select` chooses the session the local commands act on. For driven
work, the model uses `ssh_run` (bounded, 120 s max timeout, optional
bounded stdin - never for credentials).

### Interactive shells

`/ssh-shell` opens a full-screen terminal (nano, vim, htop, top, less all
render properly). All keys go to the remote program - including Esc;
**Ctrl+] exits locally**. The model drives programs through
`ssh_open_shell` + `ssh_send_keys` / `ssh_paste` / `ssh_peek` /
`ssh_resize` / `ssh_interrupt` / `ssh_close`.

### Transfer files

`/ssh-upload` + `/ssh-download` (or the model's `ssh_upload` /
`ssh_download`): files or whole directory trees, symlinks never followed,
cancellable, `--preserve` restores timestamps/permissions.

### Manage remote files

Model tools: `ssh_list_dir`, `ssh_read_file`, `ssh_stat`, `ssh_write_file`,
`ssh_mkdir`, `ssh_rename`, `ssh_remove` - every mutation needs local-user
approval.

### Model tools

20 tools: `ssh_status`, `ssh_connect`, `ssh_disconnect`, `ssh_run`,
`ssh_open_shell`, `ssh_send_keys`, `ssh_paste`, `ssh_resize`, `ssh_close`,
`ssh_peek`, `ssh_interrupt`, `ssh_upload`, `ssh_download`, `ssh_list_dir`,
`ssh_read_file`, `ssh_stat`, `ssh_write_file`, `ssh_mkdir`, `ssh_rename`,
`ssh_remove`. A bundled `ssh` skill teaches the model the workflow.

### Credential isolation

Connections are saved in your local `ssh.json`; the model only ever sees
saved NAMES and opaque session/shell ids. Credentials are collected by
local prompts, all model-facing output is redacted, and errors are mapped
to safe categories (timeout, cancelled, not connected, unavailable) - no
host/port/key diagnostics ever reach the model.

## **aftc-codex (PI skills on steroids - codex knowledge base)**

An OPT-IN, self-educating knowledge base: the core rules + thinking
guidance + a generated resource list ride your system prompt, and the model
fetches topic docs on demand with `codex_load` (aliases: ts, py, js;
specials: rules, guidance, list, markdown). It ships with only the core
rules and guidance - no ready-made topic docs. The knowledge base is yours
to build: as you work it learns your usage patterns and the kinds of
projects you build, so it adapts to you rather than inheriting the
extension author's habits and AI-usage style.

**Context cost - what you should know before enabling:**

- **Just turning it on costs nothing** - in a normal (TUI) session the codex
  only loads once you run `/codex-init`; the fresh-session "AFTC CODEX"
  banner is display-only and never reaches the model. (Print/headless mode
  auto-preps, so the cost starts there without any command.)
- **After `/codex-init` (prepped)**, the rules + thought guidance + resource
  list ride the **cached system prompt prefix: roughly 50 KB (~12-13K
  tokens) on every turn**, plus the AI loads the detected project topics'
  docs into the chat. It is cache-friendly (byte-stable - cache-hits after
  the first turn) but it occupies window space and counts toward your usage
  every turn.
- **Loading 1 to 5 resources is light; loading 20 can be costly** - load
  what the current task needs, not everything at once.
- **Tip: create a `plan.md` and a `tasks.md` first** so you can maximise
  your use of the codex skills.

- `/codex` - settings menu (enable, guidance inject, auto-detect & load,
  auto insert of the codex stack into AGENTS.md, resources & updates).
- `/codex-enable` / `/codex-disable` - turn the knowledge base on/off.
- `/codex-init` / `/codex-refresh` - prep the session (auto-detects your
  project's stack and loads the relevant docs) / strip + re-prep.
- `/codex-status` - state and resource counts.
- `/codex-list` - scrollable full-screen list of every available codex
  resource (first item highlighted, ↑/↓ to move, type to filter; the
  Documentation & Planning guide is pinned at the top; headless prints).
- `/codex-load` - pick one codex resource to load from a menu (type to
  filter); Enter picks it and the menu closes - the AI loads it right
  away - works even in rules-only /
  un-prepped sessions (it's the same as telling the AI "codex load
  <resource>").
- `/codex-install` - wipe the codex and restore the shipped basics (rules
  + guidance; your resources folder starts empty).
- `/codex-learn` - record durable lessons via the `codex_add_entry` /
  `codex_edit_entry` / `codex_remove_entry` tools (IDs generated, formats
  validated, generality + secrets guards enforced).
- `/codex-inject-rules` - session-only critical-rules injection (works
  even when disabled; cleared by `/new`).

Your live copy lives in your data dir (`aftc-codex/`). It ships with only
the core rules + guidance - the topic docs are yours to build with
`/codex-learn` (or `codex_add_entry`), and your resources are never touched
by an update.

<br><br>

## **Usage report**

`/usage-report` seeds a small report web app into your data dir
(`usage-report/`), generates a fresh `data.json` from your recorded
usage, and starts a bundled local server in its own terminal window -
your browser opens automatically. No internet needed: Chart.js ships
with the app. Close the server window (or Ctrl+C) to stop it; it also
shuts itself down after 30 minutes idle. Requires Node.js (you have it
if pi runs). Every assistant turn is recorded as metrics only -
**never prompt or response text**. `/usage-clear` wipes the database
behind a confirmation.

### Overview

![Overview tab](images/ur-overview.png)

Six headline cards (all-time totals and averages): total cost, cost per
completed task, user prompts, the User/AI prompt ratio, the worst token
burner and average cache hit — followed by a 30-day spend chart, a
cost-share doughnut with a window selector, and a six-pane period summary
(last 24 hours / last 3 days / last week / this week / this month / last
month), each pane naming the best and worst models for cost, task time,
prompting efficiency and cache.

### Costs Per Model

![Costs Per Model tab](images/ur-costs-per-model.png)

The hero/shame ranking: a per-model sortable table with a period selector
showing average cost per turn, average task cost, User/AI prompts, cache,
context use, errors and task time — with verdict badges that call out the
best and worst model per metric ("why" tooltips on hover).

### Thinking levels

![Thinking levels tab](images/ur-thinking-levels.png)

The same per-model table broken down by thinking level (one row per
model × thinking-level combination): cost, task cost, User/AI prompts,
cache, think and response times, and task time — sortable, with a period
selector.

### Timings

![Timings tab](images/ur-timings.png)

Task Time analysis: average and longest task, turns per task, error and
abort counts, task time by model, a daily average chart, where the time
goes (thinking vs responding), user- vs AI-turn timings, and the top-10
longest completed tasks.

### Projections

![Projections tab](images/ur-projections.png)

Usage-rate cost projections: average $/turn and $/task, tasks per active
day, and projected 7/30/90/365-day spend built from your own pace — per
model and overall, with a period selector. Zero-cost models are excluded.

### Context & Allowance

![Context & Allowance tab](images/ur-context-allowance.png)

Context-window pressure: 5h/7d token burn, the 1M-window rate, context
used before and after each task, % of window, tasks until the window
fills — plus the provider-reported 5h / weekly allowance consumed per
task (Codex, Claude, MiniMax, Z.ai GLM and Kimi only; other providers
show N/A).

### Errors

![Errors tab](images/ur-errors.png)

Failed calls per model × error type (rate limit, overloaded, not found,
auth, timeout, network) with a fair error rate over completed tasks — your
own aborts are a stat on Timings, not errors. The failed-calls-by-model
chart reports model + provider (thinking levels are merged — a failed
call is a provider issue). Below that, a **Tool errors**
section lists failed tool calls (wrong args, stale edit anchors, bad regex,
missing files, timeouts) with repeat-mistake highlighting; the example
column is sanitized before it reaches the report — no file paths, URLs or
project code, capped at 100 characters.

## **/docx project documentation generator**

Regenerates a project's full documentation set: a fresh GitHub README
(written last), plus `./docx/` - master document, structure map, and a
mirrored tree of ID-prefixed deep docs - per the shipped documentation
guide. Before anything is generated, existing documentation is moved to
`./docx/old_docs/` (zipped into `./docx/backups/` as a timestamped backup
at the end); AGENTS.md is edited in place, never replaced.

> **WARNING: this will re-write readme.md** (AGENTS.md is edited in place,
> never replaced) **and move all existing documentation** - your docs folder
> moves to `./docx/old_docs/`, zipped into `./docx/backups/` when the run
> completes. **Run `/new` first, then `/docx`** - a fresh session means no
> compaction risk mid-generation and no prior conversation steering the
> docs. Expect a **LONG wait** on larger projects: measured runs used only
> 5-8% of a 1M-token window and even large projects stayed under 20%, but
> the bigger and more complex the project, the longer it takes.

```text
/docx                # confirmations + project-type picker (auto-detect pre-selected)
/docx --yes          # headless: skip confirmations
/docx --type <key>   # headless: pick the prompt pack
```

Already have a `./docx/` set? `/docx-update` reconciles it with the source
instead of regenerating: new files get docs, removed files lose theirs,
drifted docs are corrected in place, and your README is fact-checked
WITHOUT being rewritten (same gates, confirmations and backup).

Safeguards: refuses at ≥25% context use (compaction-corruption risk),
advises `/new` at ≥20%, verified backup counts, sub-project folders stay
read-only.

<br><br>

## **Think-tag processing**

Models that emit thinking as inline `<think>…</think>` text tags (the
DeepSeek/Qwen convention) get those tags converted into pi's native
collapsible thinking blocks at message-finalize time. Off by default:
`/aftc-enable-think-processing` / `/aftc-disable-think-processing`. Safe by
construction: skips messages that already have thinking blocks, errored /
aborted turns, and provider-signed text.

---

<br><br>

## **Cache diagnostics**

Everything the footer shows, on demand:

- `/cache-profile` - per-tool schema token costs, skills loaded, cache
  prefix shape (system/tools/prefix hashes), churn analysis.
- `/cache-stats` - session cache statistics, cache-write ROI (net saved,
  payback turns), cost burn rate.
- `/cache-reset` - zero the accumulators (debugging).
- `/cls` - clear the terminal screen.

Hit-rate formula: `cacheRead / (cacheRead + input)` - pi's `input` is NEW
prompt tokens only. Prefix churn (system prompt or tool schema changes
breaking the cache) is detected per turn and warned.

---

<br><br>

## **run_script (reliable large scripts)**

The `run_script` model tool writes the script body to a temp file and runs
`bash <file>` - no inline-size limit, working around pi's bash-tool
truncation bug (a few KB+ inline commands get silently cut). Bash-only
(git-bash on Windows); default timeout 120 s, max 1800 s. Toggle:
`/run-script-on` / `/run-script-off` (default on).


---

<br><br>

## **Background Terminals (/bt)**

Start long-running shell commands in the background and keep working while
they run. The model uses `bg_start` / `bg_status` / `bg_list` / `bg_kill`;
you use `/bt` — a scrollable list of the running terminals: Enter on a row
asks "yes/no" and stops that terminal, the `TERMINATE ALL` row at the top
stops everything at once, Esc closes. No stdin,
session-scoped (killed on /new or /reload), max 8 at once, off by default
(`/bt-on` then `/reload`). A one-line widget shows how many are running.

---

<br><br>

## **Copy All (/copy-all)**

`/copy-all` copies every previous user and assistant message in the current
thread to the clipboard, joined with `---` separators (thinking excluded,
bounded to 2 MB).

---

<br><br>

## **File Search**

Moved to the [pi-kitten](https://github.com/xdblue/pi-kitten) package:
`extensions/file-search/` there owns the `fd` + `rg` tools and their
`fileSearchEnabled` preference. The copy that used to live in this
repository (`extensions/aftc-toolset/file-search/`) was removed to keep one
source of truth. Install pi-kitten to get the tools back.

---

<br><br>

## Sub Agents (/007)

Delegate focused work to isolated child pi processes. Each sub-agent runs in
its own fresh context window with a profile-locked toolset and hands back a
bounded report - your main session stays clean. Nine built-in agents ship
(worker, planner, researcher, reviewer, explorer, advisor, documenter,
designer, tester); make your own in your agents folder (a guide file lives
there too).

- **Off by default** - enable and configure via `/007` - Settings.
- `/007` is the main menu: browse agents, active work, settings, guide.
- `/007-status` shows a live table of running agents.
- The footer (line 6) shows what sub-agents are running while /007 is enabled.
- Your agents live in your data dir (`subagents/`); `/007-edit` tweaks them.

---

<br><br>

## **AFTC Resume (/aftc-resume-save /aftc-resume)**

Hand work off between context windows. As you work, when you want a clean
handoff point - or before the context window gets unwieldy - run
`/aftc-resume-save`:

1. An existing `aftc-resume.md` is renamed to a timestamped snapshot
   (`aftc-resume-<last-modified>.md`) so old states are never lost.
2. The model stops and writes the handoff file (`./aftc-resume.md`): Goal,
   Current State, Decisions Made, Knowledge Learned, Key Files, Tasks &
   Progress (referencing `tasks.md` when you follow one), Next Steps, Open
   Questions.
3. The toolset merges a `## Resume metadata` block (project, saved time,
   codex resources loaded, status) and verifies the save.

Then `/new`, and run `/aftc-resume` to restore your knowledge in the fresh
window:

- The model reads `aftc-resume.md` first.
- Codex resources listed in the handoff are re-loaded via `codex_load`
  (only when codex is enabled - the flow works with it on or off; key files
  are always the fallback).
- It reads BOTH docx docs (`docx/project_documentation.md` and
  `docx/project_map.md` - each only when present) and re-reads AGENTS.md.
- It confirms it is up to speed in a few short lines and then waits for
  your direction — it does NOT continue the saved task on its own. The
  handoff's Next Steps are reference; say something like "continue the
  saved work" when you want it to pick the task back up.

Notes:

- **The `/new` is always yours** - the toolset never starts a session on its
  own.
- When the work described in the handoff is complete, the model flips its
  `status:` line to `completed`, so a stale handoff is recognisable.
- The handoff + snapshots are transient work state - add `aftc-resume.md`
  (and `aftc-resume-*.md`) to `.gitignore`, `.npmignore` and
  `.dockerignore` if you commit or publish the project (this package's own
  repo ships these rules in all three).

---

<br><br>

## Audio notifications

Play event sounds as pi works - enabled via the `/aftc-audio-notifications`
settings hub, which also has per-category sound pickers and an "open sounds
dir" option. Off by default (fresh installs are silent).

- Sounds fire for: startup, when the agent asks a question, task complete,
  error, aborted, and when context-window usage crosses 25% / 50% / 75%.
- `/aftc-notify-time [sec]` sets the minimum task duration before the
  completion sound plays (0 disables it).
- Context-window alerts fire on the way UP past a threshold and stay quiet
  until usage genuinely drops back below it - reloading or resuming never
  replays them.

| `/007-edit [name]` | Agent picker → options menu (feature toggles, edit raw file, reset to default) |
| `/007-reset <name>` | Reset an agent to the shipped default (with confirmation) |
| `/007-install` | Seed the built-in agents into your agents folder |
| `/007-sync` | Merge improved shipped agents in without touching your edits |
| `/007-open-agent-dir` | Open your agents folder in the OS file manager |
| `/007-guide` | The sub-agents walkthrough |

| `/007-doctor` | Check your sub-agents setup |

### Audio notification

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/aftc-audio-notifications` (alias `/aftc-notifications`) | Settings hub: enable toggle + per-category sound pickers (startup, question, task-complete, error, aborted, context 25/50/75%) + open the sounds dir |
| `/aftc-notify-time [sec]` | Show or set the minimum task duration before the completion sound (0 disables) |

### aftc-codex

See the [aftc-codex](#aftc-codex-knowledge-base) section - `/codex`,
`/codex-enable`, `/codex-disable`, `/codex-init`, `/codex-refresh`,
`/codex-status`, `/codex-list`, `/codex-load`, `/codex-install`,
`/codex-learn`, `/codex-inject-rules` (+ `/aftc-codex-*` full names).

### Providers

Currently **disabled** - pi now registers providers natively. The module stays in the package and can be re-enabled in a future release.

## Data location

The toolset stores its runtime data - usage history (`turns.db`), preferences (`config.json`), saved SSH connections (`ssh.json`), the live codex (`aftc-codex/`), sub-agent config and agents (`subagents-config.json`, `subagents/`), the debug log (`debug.log`) and the report web app (`usage-report/` with its generated `data.json`) - in a per-user folder **outside** the installed package, so it survives `pi update`. Location per operating system:

| OS | Data folder |
| --- | --- |
| **Windows** | `%APPDATA%\pi-aftc-toolset\data\` (eg `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\pi-aftc-toolset\data\`) |
| **Linux** | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/pi-aftc-toolset/data/`, falling back to `~/.local/share/pi-aftc-toolset/data/` |
| **macOS** | `~/Library/Application Support/pi-aftc-toolset/data/` |

Set the `AFTC_TOOLSET_DATA_ROOT` environment variable to override the location (used by tests and power users). `/qd` opens the folder in your file manager.

> **Uninstall note:** this folder lives outside the package, so `pi remove` does **not** delete it - your usage history and preferences remain after uninstall. Delete the folder above manually for a full clean-up.

<br><br>

## Updating

```bash
pi update npm:pi-aftc-toolset
```

or install a pinned GitHub release:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/DarceyLloyd/pi-aftc-toolset@v<version>
```

Then `/reload` in pi. When an update ships new codex rules or guidance, the
shipped copy is refreshed in your live codex automatically on startup - your
own codex resources are never touched.

---

<br><br>

## Uninstall

```bash
pi remove npm:pi-aftc-toolset          # global
pi remove npm:pi-aftc-toolset -l       # project-local
```

or if you installed via GitHub:

```bash
pi remove git:github.com/DarceyLloyd/pi-aftc-toolset
```

Then `/reload` or restart pi.

## Advanced installation

### npm variants

```bash
pi install npm:pi-aftc-toolset          # global
pi install npm:pi-aftc-toolset -l       # project-local
pi -e npm:pi-aftc-toolset               # ephemeral (current session only)
```

### GitHub variants

```bash
pi install git:github.com/DarceyLloyd/pi-aftc-toolset         # latest main
pi install git:github.com/DarceyLloyd/pi-aftc-toolset@v1.6.0  # pinned release
pi install git:github.com/DarceyLloyd/pi-aftc-toolset -l      # project-local
```

> GitHub installs skip npm post-install hooks - run `/aftc-install` once after the first install.

### Local clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DarceyLloyd/pi-aftc-toolset.git
pi install /path/to/pi-aftc-toolset -l
```

## Dependency installer

`/aftc-install` (see [Slash Commands](#slash-commands)) installs and verifies:

- `better-sqlite3` via `npm install`
- Packaged SSH carrier dependencies via `uv sync --locked`
- The platform-native `uv` executable, using `uv.exe` on Windows and `uv` on Linux and macOS
- A Python 3 interpreter (`py`/`python` on Windows, `python3`/`python` elsewhere)

If Node, Python, or `uv` is missing it reports platform-specific recovery guidance without exposing saved connection data.

Reload pi afterwards. The footer works without SQLite, but usage recording, reporting, and SSH require `/aftc-install`.

---

<br><br>

## Requirements

- pi CLI (developed against 0.83.0)
- Node.js / npm
- Providers that expose `usage.cacheRead` and `usage.cacheWrite` for full cache metrics (other providers may show zero / incomplete cache values)
- Python 3.10+ and uv for the packaged SSH carrier. `/aftc-install` verifies the carrier environment.

---

<br><br>

## Development

Install from a clone:

```bash
pi install /path/to/pi-aftc-toolset -l
```

After edits, reload pi with `/reload`. Full developer documentation
(workflow, release discipline, architecture) lives in `./docx/`; how to
run the tests (which suites, timeouts, the full-suite policy) is in
AGENTS.md.

## Persistent files

Runtime data lives in a per-user folder **outside** the installed package
(see [Data location](#data-location)), so it survives `pi update`. Every
file is created lazily from built-in defaults - none of it is shipped or
committed, and the whole data dir is excluded from git and npm publishing.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `config.json` | Cross-session user preferences: footer (on/off, averages line on/off, timeframe window), response divider, think-tag processing, intro animation, audio notifications, replay prompt, run_script tool and aftc-codex switches. Created with defaults on first access; only re-written when a value actually changes. |
| `ssh.json` | Local SSH connection metadata (name, username, host, port, timeout, optional key path, optional saved password) + new-host-key auto-accept flag. Local-only, never shipped. |
| `turns.db` | SQLite usage database (turns + tasks tables - metrics only, never prompt text) |
| `usage-report/` | Seeded report web app + freshly generated `data.json` (your recorded usage) |
| `debug.log` | Rotating `[aftc-toolset]` diagnostic log (5 MB cap + one `.old` generation) |
| `aftc-codex/` | Your live codex knowledge base (ships the core rules + guidance; the topic docs are yours to build) |
| `subagents-config.json` | Sub Agents (/007) preferences: presets, concurrency, budgets, watchdogs |
| `subagents/` | Your live sub-agents (seeded built-ins you can edit) + per-run records |

**Your data survives updates.** Because the data dir is outside the
package, `pi update` no longer wipes it. Upgrading from a version that
stored data inside the install folder moves any still-present files over
automatically on first run (data already lost to an older update can't be
recovered).

In-memory only (per-session, not persisted): cache accumulators, model info, per-turn timings, context-window clock start time.

SSH sessions, shell buffers, credentials, and carrier processes are in-memory only and are cleared during shutdown.
